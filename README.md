# rpgphysics
An experimentation of game physics using Unity2D. Scripts are in C#. Pixel art prefabs and animations were made with Photoshop. There's a pixel art roach somewhere in there that's my favorite guy - when the player character smacks him, he explodes into green goo. Also there's a large, round black bear that rolls away if you toggle some of his collider settings and walk the player character into him. I spent much time scripting a bird that walks around randomly - only for it to walk away from me, and I'm not a fan of how it only walks in horizontal or vertical paths, so that was a bummer. On that note, there is no real story or map to the game file - I was just figuring out colliders and other "physical" settings.
